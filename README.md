# PSAT
An unofficial repository for the Power Systems Analysis Toolbox (PSAT) by Federico Milano

The official webpage is [http://faraday1.ucd.ie/psat.html](http://faraday1.ucd.ie/psat.html)

This repository is started from the official version 2.1.11+.

As modifications are made, they will be indicated in the source files as required by the license (GPL). The modifications can also be identified using Git of course.


# Goals

The hope is that Github will prove to be a better platform for the community than the official yahoo groups page.


# Contributing

Simplest way to contribute is to create as many examples as possible, regardless if they are too simple or not. Please head to the Wiki section for more information. In particular, we would like to see example problems in the book by Kundur expressed within PSAT.
